Day 39 at The Iron Yard. (Week-Long Project)

The purpose of this application is to allow a venue's patrons to vote for musicians that they want to see play at the venue.

1. I used React components to build the following:
  - A Nav, which has links that change depending on if the user is logged in or not. Those links are to:
    - Login Page
    - Register Page
    - Logout
    - Votes Page
    - Search Page

2. I used Spotify's API for the Search Page. Each search result the user gets has an artist's image, name, and a vote button. Once they click on the vote button, they are navigated to the Votes page.

3. I used Backendless to save the artists that the users vote for and then display those, along with the number of votes they each have, on the Votes page.

4. I performed some testing on my Models and Collections as well.
